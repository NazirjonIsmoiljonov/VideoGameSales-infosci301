# Video Games Sales Data Visualization

This repository contains code and a dataset for an interactive data visualization project for **INFOSCI 301 - Data Visualization** at **DukeKunshan University**. The project explores video game sales data using interactive visualizations built with Plotly in a Google Colab environment.

## Overview

This project aims to provide insights into:
- **Platform Popularity by Year:** Analysis of global sales across major gaming platforms over time.
- **Genre Popularity by Year:** Trends in video game genres based on sales.
- **Regional Sales for Top Games:** A comparative view of regional sales (North America, Europe, Japan, and others) for the top best-selling games.

The interactive plots let you hover for details, zoom in/out, and explore different aspects of the dataset dynamically.
